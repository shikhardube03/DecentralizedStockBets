In this Project, I've built a Web3 Application called Stock Betting Dapp using which a person can bet against various stocks and see their prices. This Dapp is fully decentralized, thereby, showcasing the power of Web3 & Blockchain. In order to add an amazing design to it, I've used tailwindCSS and Next.js in it. So, just use it and have fun!!!
